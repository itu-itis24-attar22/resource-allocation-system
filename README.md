# Resource Allocation System (Iterative Prototype)

This repository contains an iterative C++ prototype for a university resource allocation system, with a Flask web dashboard for demonstration.

The project focuses on gradually developing a flexible allocation system for resources such as classrooms, laboratories, meeting rooms, exams, and committee meetings. The implementation follows an iterative software design approach, where each iteration introduces one or more new concepts into the prototype.

The latest implemented iteration is Iteration 40, with SpaceFactory and BackendResultAdapter refinements.

## Current Prototype Features

The current prototype supports:

- abstract `Request` base class with inheritance
- request types:
  - `OneTimeRequest`
  - `RecurringRequest`
  - `ExamRequest`
  - `CommitteeMeetingRequest`
  - `InvalidRequest`
- request title and purpose metadata
- request lifecycle history logging:
  - created
  - evaluated
  - approved or rejected
  - exported
- request creation through `RequestFactory`
- invalid request capture for malformed rows, duplicate request IDs, unresolved users, unresolved spaces, and invalid time data
- allocation of multiple space types:
  - `Classroom`
  - `Laboratory`
  - `MeetingRoom`
- space creation through `SpaceFactory`
- user polymorphism through `UserFactory`:
  - `Student`
  - `TeachingAssistant`
  - `Staff`
  - `Instructor`
  - `Administrator`
- role-based request priority values
- space-type authorization through `UserRoleRule`
- request-type authorization through `RequestTypeRule`
- rule-based request evaluation using:
  - `RuleEngine`
  - `RuleEngineFacade`
- strategy-based allocation using:
  - `IAllocationStrategy`
  - `GreedyAllocationStrategy`
  - `PriorityAllocationStrategy`
  - `MultiRoomExamGreedyStrategy`
  - `MultiRoomExamBestFitStrategy`
  - `SharedRoomExamBestFitStrategy`
- strategy selection through `AllocationStrategyFactory` and `data/config.txt`
- exam resource sharing:
  - one exam can be split across multiple classrooms
  - best-fit room selection can reduce unused capacity
  - compatible exams can share the same room using remaining room capacity
- `assignedParticipants` stored in each `Allocation`
- minute-based `TimeSlot` support with backward compatibility for older hour-only data
- committee meeting support:
  - `RequestParticipant`
  - `data/request_participants.csv`
  - `UserBusySlot`
  - `data/user_busy_slots.csv`
  - `UserAvailabilityService`
  - `ParticipantAvailabilityRule`
  - `MeetingTimeSuggestion`
  - `MeetingTimeSuggestionService`
  - least-change ranked alternative meeting time suggestions
- centralized CSV loading and exporting through `DataController`
- backend workflow coordination through `ResourceAllocationSession`
- data-loading robustness:
  - duplicate user IDs are skipped with a warning
  - duplicate space IDs are skipped with a warning
  - auxiliary busy-slot and participant paths can be configured when loading data
- structured backend summary exports through `SummaryWriter`
- explicit export success/failure handling:
  - `AllocationWriter`, `RequestResultWriter`, and `SummaryWriter` return `bool`
  - `DataController` export methods return success/failure
  - `ResourceAllocationSession::exportResults(...)` returns `true` only when all exports succeed
- CSV export of:
  - allocations
  - request results
  - request summaries
  - allocation summaries
- Flask web dashboard for demo usage
- backend-result adaptation for Flask views through `BackendResultAdapter`
- web-based request creation, including committee meeting participant selection
- web-based `Submit and Run` workflow
- web-based request detail pages
- web-based Allocation Summary page
- web-based Raw Data page
- web-based Schedules page for user busy slots and room allocations
- rejection reasons and backend-generated meeting suggestions displayed in the dashboard

## Implemented Rules

The prototype currently evaluates requests using the following rules:

- `RequestTypeRule`
- `UserRoleRule`
- `ParticipantAvailabilityRule`
- `CapacityRule`
- `FeatureRule`
- `StatusRule`
- `LocationRule`
- `AvailabilityRule`

`RequestTypeRule` checks whether a requester can submit the selected request type. `UserRoleRule` checks whether the requester can use the requested space type. `ParticipantAvailabilityRule` checks required human participants for `CommitteeMeetingRequest` objects. `AvailabilityRule` checks physical room time availability.

The effective normal rule order is:

```text
RequestTypeRule
-> UserRoleRule
-> ParticipantAvailabilityRule
-> CapacityRule
-> FeatureRule
-> StatusRule
-> LocationRule
-> AvailabilityRule
```

- [LaTeX Source](docs/design/Design_Patterns_and_Principles_Report.tex)

## Data Files

The prototype currently uses CSV files in the `data/` folder:

- `users.csv`
- `spaces.csv`
- `requests.csv`
- `request_participants.csv`
- `user_busy_slots.csv`
- `config.txt`
- `allocations.csv` (generated output)
- `request_results.csv` (generated output)
- `request_summaries.csv` (generated output)
- `allocation_summaries.csv` (generated output)

The selected allocation strategy is configured in `data/config.txt`. The current demo configuration is:

```text
allocation_strategy=shared_room_exam_best_fit
```

## Testing and Verification

A formal backend testing report source is available under `docs/testing/`:

- [Backend_Testing_Report.tex](docs/testing/Backend_Testing_Report.tex)

PDF exports are also stored in `docs/testing/` when generated.

The current lightweight test suite is run with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\run_tests.ps1
```

The latest verified result is:

```text
Running 79 test(s)
Result: 79 passed, 0 failed
```

The test runner compiles and runs the backend smoke executable, then compiles and runs the unit and integration tests.

## How to Compile and Run Backend

From PowerShell in the project root:

```powershell
$sources = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path src -Filter *.cpp | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }
g++ -std=c++17 $sources -o allocation_system
```

Run:

```powershell
.\allocation_system.exe
```

The backend loads CSV files, reads `data/config.txt`, processes requests with the selected strategy, prints request outcomes, and exports `allocations.csv`, `request_results.csv`, `request_summaries.csv`, and `allocation_summaries.csv`.

## How to Run Web Dashboard

Install Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Run from the project root:

```bash
python web/app.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The web dashboard does not implement allocation logic. It reads and writes CSV files for demo usage and runs the compiled C++ backend. The C++ backend remains responsible for rules, strategies, participant availability, meeting suggestions, and allocation.

## Web Dashboard Overview

The current dashboard supports:

- strategy selection on the Dashboard page
- `Run Allocation`
- `Add Request` for `OneTime`, `Recurring`, `Exam`, and `CommitteeMeeting`
- `Submit and Run` for quickly adding a request and viewing its backend result
- committee participant selection with participant roles
- searchable Requests page
- request detail pages at `/request/<requestId>`
- Allocation Summary cards for approved, rejected, and pending requests
- display of committee participants, rejection reasons, and least-change suggestions
- Schedules page for user busy slots and space allocations
- Raw Data page for direct CSV inspection

Flask does not check participant availability and does not compute suggestions. Those behaviors belong to the C++ backend.

## Demo Workflow

1. Compile the backend.
2. Run the Flask dashboard.
3. Select an allocation strategy.
4. Add or review requests.
5. Use `Save Request Only` for batch entry, or `Submit and Run` for a focused one-request demo.
6. Open `Allocation Summary` or the request detail page.
7. Use `Schedules` to inspect user busy slots and room allocations after allocation has run.

## Notes

This repository is an iterative academic prototype. The current implementation focuses on architecture, extensibility, rule-driven evaluation, and demonstration workflows rather than production-level persistence.

Future work can build on the current structure with alternative-room meeting suggestions, future-only suggestion modes, participant-conflict-aware ranking, global optimization, database or API integration, and richer calendar integration.
